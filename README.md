### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a C++ developer and synbio enthusiast. In the past, I've worked on [CadBerry](https://github.com/CamelCaseCam/CadBerry), an IDE and programming language for synthetic biology. I've also dabbled in AI, smartwatch app development, web development with React, and bioinformatics. 

I'm in-between projects right now, but working on the side on a chrome extension for filtering spam from search results. If this or anything else you've seen interests you, feel free to email me at [cameron.kroll@gmail.com](mailto:cameron.kroll@gmail.com)
